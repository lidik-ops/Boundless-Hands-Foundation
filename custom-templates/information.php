      <h4 style="color: rgb(37,170,226); font-size: 30px;"><strong>Report on the follow-up visit to Ngora Primary School for the Deaf on August 9, 2019</strong></h4>
 <h6 style="color: rgb(244,148,31); font-size: 15px;"> <strong>PRELUDE</strong> </h6>
 <p>
 On April 13, 2019, Boundless Hands Foundation Ltd, with support from Land Rover Uganda Club, visited and 
 donated various items to Ngora Primary School for the Deaf. Located in Kumi district (Eastern Uganda), this
  is one of the only three specialized schools in Uganda, providing nursery, primary and vocational training.
   The activities of our charity drive were documented in a report compiled by Doreen Sandra Kauma. For purposes
    of accountability, clear focus, streamlined leadership and planning, we returned to the school to establish
     the impact of our donations. This report highlights what transpired during the follow-up visit on August 9,
      2019.
Arthur Matsiko and Doreen left Kampala at 6:00am and arrived in Mbale town at 11:00am where we met 
Mackay Mwebingwa and Hope Nandudu. We bought 50kg of rice at Shs 140,000 and soda at Shs 175,000 using part of
 the money that remained on our first visit (Shs 300,000). By 1:30pm, we were at the school where we held a 
 meeting in the headmaster’s office with some staff members. They expressed gratitude towards our humble
  donations. We held a Question and Answer session with the staff members about each item we donated, and
   where more is needed (if we are to plan and return next year). We had donated sanitary pads, mattresses, 
   first aid kits, scholastic materials and blankets, among others. We discussed each item, the impact and
    identified areas where we could do more to keep the pupils in school.
 </p>

 <h6 style="color: rgb(244,148,31); font-size: 15px;"> SANITARY PADS </h6>
<p>
During,our charity drive, we delivered four boxes of reusable pads. In our discussion, the staff members noted
 that the pads enhanced menstrual hygiene and there was a reduction on the termly expenses on buying single-use 
 pads. The head teacher told us most parents send the girls without knickers and sanitary pads. So the school 
 would always use part of the UPE funds (Shs 600,000 per term) to buy pads. Senior Woman Teacher, Sarah Anyait,
  told us nobody in history had ever donated anything to Ngora Primary School for the Deaf. Anyait and other 
  female staff taught the girls on how to use, wash and dry the pads to maintain hygiene.
<p><strong>Our reaction</strong></p>
We were humbled by their positive reaction to our unpretentious outreach. To reduce on the expenses, we advised them to consider buying reusable pads since they are more durable than the single-use ones. We advised staff to consider training the girls on how to make reusable sanitary pads for their use and sale. However, Heart to Hands Foundation should discuss this idea and craft ways of providing the startup raw materials and training to the pupils. This, we believe is a more sustainable way of maintaining menstrual hygiene at the school.
</p>

<H6 style="color: rgb(244,148,31); font-size: 15px;">MATTRESSES</H6>
<P> 
Teachers told us that before our outreach, pupils used to sleep on empty metallic beds, while the rest
 would sleep on dog-eared beddings. Although the school has a population of 160 pupils, we delivered 30.
  This left 130 pupils with no beddings. This was evident when we visited the dormitories. Most of the beds
   no mattresses, some had torn pieces of cushions, while others were bare. As to whether the staff considered
    the girls first, head teacher said they distributed equally to avoid violence from the boys.
<p><strong>Our reaction</strong></p>
We realize there is still need for more support for the kids. And this challenges us to caucus and mobilise for more funds to ensure these vulnerable pupils get the basic needs while at school.
</P>

<h6 style="color: rgb(244,148,31); font-size: 15px;">DRUGS</h6>
<p>
Teachers said the idea of drugs was timely because there is no medical facility within the school. They noted
 that some of the drugs were new to them, and they had to inquire from a trained medical person who would later 
 administer the medicines to respective sick pupils. Although the school does not have a nurse, they always
  invite a medical person from Ngora Freddacar Hospital to carry out medical checkups on the pupils. 
  The hospital is in about 100 metres away from the school.
<p><strong>Our reaction</strong></p>
Although it is essential to have a medical person within the school, we encouraged them to keep utilizing the
 available personnel at the Ngora Freddacar Hospital bearing in mind the scarcity of resources.
</p>

<h6 style="color: rgb(244,148,31); font-size: 15px;"> OTHER NEEDS</h6>
<P>
Visual aids for classwork
Text books
Atlases
Bibles (Mackay will follow-up on this)
Dictionaries (We remember George Kas had promised some dictionaries)
Mosquito nets (although all dormitory windows have wire mesh)
400,000 for sports kits had been pledged by Emma
Safe water for drinking. Each classroom has a pot and a plastic cup; whoever feels thirsty simply draws water
 from the pot using the only available cup, drinks and puts the cup back. The teachers requested for a more
  hygienic way of accessing drinking water.
</P>

<h6 style="color: rgb(244,148,31); font-size: 15px;">PARENT-PUPIL RELATIONSHIP </h6>
<P>
Although parents are required to visit their children for at least once a term, the case is different at Ngora 
Primary School for the Deaf. Teachers revealed most parents send their children and never visit them. This, 
they said, includes pupils under sponsorship by various NGOs. The argument is that an NGO would pay school
 fees and leave the rest to the parents, most of whom show no concern to the children’s stay at school. 
 To this, the headmaster told us he sometimes uses his own money to buy uniforms and other scholastic materials 
 for such children who have almost nobody to their help. Although the school has a person responsible for
  talking to parents about the fate of their children at school, it is reported that he has always been
   welcomed by hostility whenever he attempts to talk to the parents. Meanwhile, children feel more comfortable
    at school than at their respective homes because they are reportedly always isolated at home.
